This data is from 10  months of minirhizotron images taken every 2 weeks at the experimental warming Tropical Responses to Altered Climate Experiment (TRACE) plots in Puerto Rico before and after Hurricanes Irma and Maria. This project has 3 warmed plots (plot 2,4,6) and 3 control plots (plot 1,3,5) with 2 minirhizotron tubes at each plot. As part of the data, there is also root data taken from cores and in-growth cores. Additionally, there is soil nutrient concentration data, soil microclimate, total leaf area, and canopy openness taken by Reed et al. 2020, and the TRACE census. Data files are in CSV format and the R code included in this package can be used with R 3.4.4 (R Core Team and contributors worldwide).</para>      <para>This dataset was originally published on the NGEE Tropics Archive and is being mirrored on ESS-DIVE for long-term archival</para>      <para>Acknowledgement: This data was supported as part of the Next Generation Ecosystem Experiments-Tropics, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research.

Images were collected for 7 months of the warming experiment, and 41,800 images from the 10 months after Hurricanes Irma and María. We analyzed all images using RootFly software version 2.0.2 (Clemson University, SC, USA, 2005-2011; https://www.quantitative-plant.org/software/rootfly). Additionally, Soil cores were collected using a 5 cm diameter PVC core to 10 cm depth. We manually picked all roots from each core (&lt; 2 mm in diameter), and cleaned gently with deionized water. We then scanned live fine roots using the WinRHIZO root-scanning software program (Regent Instruments, Inc., Québec, Canada) to measure total root length, and average root diameter. All roots were oven-dried at 65 °C for at least 48 h and then weighed to obtain root biomass. Measurements of soil extractable PO43-, NH4+, NO3-, total dissolved carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), and microbial biomass N, phosphorus (P), and C concentrations in these cores are described by Reed et al. (2020). Also, root in-growth cores of 5.5 cm inner diameter and 14 cm length (5 mm × 3 mm hole size) were collected every three months. These in-growth cores had homogenized, root-free soil from adjacent to the plots. Roots were manually separated from the soil following each in-growth core collection. Live fine roots were scanned to measure length, diameter, and volume as described from soil cores. All roots were then oven-dried and weighed. To estimate total leaf area per plot, we multiplied leaf count per species per plot (from TRACE annual census data) by average area per leaf. Leaf area was measured using scans of leaves and Image-J software (Rasband 1997-2018). Only woody species were included in this analysis. Finally, soil moisture and temperature were collected from plot sensors described by Kimball et al. (2018), and means per plot and session (period of MR image collection) are recorded in this database.
